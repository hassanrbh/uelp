### hey, this clone is finished, I didn't do everything but most hard stuff is done, so this is the end, I think my next startup project will be fire, I learn alot than you think 60 days no stop coding more than 280 commits, I really like this side projects, you kinda feel obligated to wakeup from 5am, work until 7, read about more of sustainability and the startup manual book I really recommand this two books, in the first one, if you have some problems with business logic and where to put it, you learn quote of "fat models , skinny controller" that fine, but in this book you will get an incredible approache that works for me perfect, and it's create a new folder called "services" or "businessLogic", the name dosen't matter, and image that this classes is a service layer between the controller and model, you provide active record arguments to access the database and that is,  I really appreciate this book, and I am still reading in it, so kindly go and checkout it, by
